hidpi-tamer
===========

An example project for a jQuery plugin that keeps HiDPI (i.e. retina) images in check.  This goes with a presentation on creating jQuery plugins for jQuery LA.

The plugin here is actually useful, especially if you ever deal with screenshots from Apple devices with retina displays, so feel free to use it!
